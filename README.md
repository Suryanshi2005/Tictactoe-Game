# Tic-Tac-Toe Python Project

This repository contains two versions of the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python:

1. Console Version: A simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the terminal.(tictactoe.py file)
2. GUI Version: A graphical version built using tkinter, where players can(tictactoegraphics.py file)


# How to run the Game
Console Version :-
 After running the script, the game will prompt Player X and Player O to enter their moves (row and column number).
 The row and column number should be in range(0,1,2) otherwise _error_ will come.
 Players take turns entering their moves until there is a winner or the game results in a tie.
 That's it! You'll be able to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game in the console or terminal.

GUI Version
This version of Tic-Tac-Toe uses a graphical grid of buttons.
When you click a button, it fills with the current player’s symbol (X or O).
The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a message when someone wins or when it’s a tie.
The game resets automatically after a win or a tie.

Features you can add :
Scoreboard : Track the scores for both players across multiple rounds.
Restart Button : Add a dedicated button for resetting the game.
AI Opponent: You can implement an AI to play against the player using a minimax algorithm.

I don't include above features in my code because I my goal is to focus on core logic of game and provide  a basic easy to understand implementation
if you like to contribute by adding these features , feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
